= xtUML Chess as C

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

This note documents a path to running an xtUML model + lichess.org
application as C generated from MC-3020.

== 2 Introduction and Background

<<dr-2>> is a git repository for an xtUML application that can play chess
through an API to <<dr-3,lichess.org>>.  The repository contains support
of Verifier and the Ciera model compiler.

It would be interesting to compare the performance of Ciera Java with
MC-3020 C in move selection.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Provide Lichess API

A Lichess API exists for Java and integrates with Java generated from
Ciera.  It also works with BridgePoint Verifier which is also a Java
application.  Either natively in C or leveraging the Lichess Java API,
supply support to communicate with the chess interface published by
<<dr-3, lichess.org>>.

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.1 Realized EEs

Two external entities (EEs) have been written for the Java support of the
Lichess API.  `PROP` and `ChessLib` provide utility routines to facilitate
communication through the Lichess API.

==== 4.1.1 `PROP`

`PROP` provides a wrapper around `java.util.Properties`.  A properties
file is used to carry user ID and authentication information.  `PROP`
supports reading the properties file and passing a Properties object.
Properties are a distincly Java notion.

For C, a couple of ideas come to mind on how to go with this.

. Read and parse the properties file in C.
  ** This has been done before.  `Poco` and `log4cplus` support reading
     and parsing Java-ish Properties files.
. Switch to a different format for the project configuration values.
  ** The first format to switch to is JSON.
. Skip it and hand edit a file with needed data.

=== 4.2 Sequence of Game

. ::init()
  .. Load configuration.  // could be hard-coded
  .. send chess::connect(config) // can be simulated by dropping JSON message to API
. recv chess::connected()
  .. send chess::account() to get User ID.
. recv chess::challenge()
  .. send chess::acceptChallenge(challenge.id)
. recv chess::GameStart(game_event)
  .. create ActiveGame
. recv chess::GameState(game_id,game_state)
  .. take turn or wait
  .. send chess::move(game_id,move)

== 5 Work Required

=== 5.1 Model, Realized Code and Model Compiler Changes

. Implement the `ARCH` EE (for the openURL bridge). [green]#(**done**)#
. Implement the `PROP` EE, perhaps switching both Java and C to using JSON.
  ** Consider skipping and using an edited JSON file as a message.
. Implement the `ChessLib` EE.
  ** Consider adding a bridge that does not return an array of strings.
. Explore the support for passing arrays of strings in MC-3020.
  ** With TagInstanceLoading turned on, we do get transient string array
     initializers.
  ** MC-3020 does not support assigning an array to an array.
     *** e.g. `legal_moves = ChessLib::legal_moves(fen:fen)`
     *** Maybe we could add `ChessLib::legal_moves(fen:fen, legal_moves:legal_moves)`
. Explore the support variable length arrays in MC-3020.
  ** How can we work around this?
     *** special EE?  [green]#(**no**)#
     *** Use fixed length arrays with a separate length value?  [green]#(**yes**)#
. Implement a communication channel between the Lichess component as Java
  and the Engine component as C.  [green]#(**done**)#
. Find a JSON parser for C (starting with the same one we started with in
  early Munin).
  ** Use <<dr-4, JSMN (Jasmine)>>. [green]#(**done**)#

=== 5.2 File Communication

* Consider POSIX threading to be more CPU friendly.
  ** Turn on POSIX threading in `system.mark`. [green]#(**done**)#
  ** Modify TIM_bridge.c to wake in 1 second if there are no ticking
     timers. [green]#(**done**)#
  ** Print from sys_user_co.c UserBackgroundCallout to prove it lives. [green]#(**done**)#
* Periodically (once per second to start with) check for a message file. [green]#(**done**)#
  ** message files will be alphanumerically ordered. [green]#(**done**)#
  ** Call Engine message from background parse routines passing in native struct types. [green]#(**done**)#
* Dump Lichess bound messages into JSON file in folder. [green]#(**done**)#
  ** `move(game_id, move)` is the primary message. [green]#(**done**)#

=== 5.3 Loading Properties

* This is kinda needed but only to get past defaults.  Skip this for now.
* send chess::account() to get User ID. (PROBLEM:  discuss)
  ** This can be hard-coded.  It is used to distinguish a challenge that was
     created by someone other than me.

=== 5.4 ChessLib

* Look for C library.  [green]#(**found one**)#
* Should we add this to the API..  [green]#(**no**)#
* Consider passing array attribute by reference.  [green]#(**done**)#

=== 5.5 Proposed Model Changes

* Use fixed length arrays, since variable length arrays are sketch in C.
  ** Decide on length of arrays.
     *** 1024 for 'GameState.moves'
     *** 218 for 'legal_moves'
* Add a 'move_count' attribute to 'ActiveGame'.
* Eschew the `length` operator on arrays.
* Modify `Chesslib::legalMoves( fen, legal_moves ) : integer legal_move_count`.
* Add explicit EEs to the model only as needed and maybe delete them after
  bridge files are coded.

=== 5.6 ChessLib

* Clone `ChessLib` from <<dr-5>>.
* Build it.
* 'Include' and link it in a makefile in the `/src` folder.

=== 5.7 README

* Update the README to give instructions on the using the C code generated bot.

== 6 Acceptance Test

. Generate code from xtuml/chess using MC-3020.
. Compile it.
. Run it.
. See it play.
