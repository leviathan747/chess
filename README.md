xtUML chess project
===================

This project provides a framework for creating bots to play chess on
[lichess.org](https://lichess.org). The project provides bindings to the
Lichess public API as well as management of challenges and games and a utility
for listing legal moves. The project is set up to run in BridgePoint Model
Verifier.

Read the announcement of the [2024 Chess Modeling Challenge](doc/announcement.md).
The results of this challenge will be highlighted at
[Shlaer-Mellor Day 2024](https://xtuml.github.io/xday/smdays2024.html)

## Prerequisites

### Download BridgePoint

Download the latest version of BridgePoint from
[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/xtuml-releases/12804-build/buildfiles.html).
Due to ongoing development related to this project, an engineering branch build
is required to run the project.

### Create a Lichess bot account

To get started, you must create an account on lichess.org. In accordance with
Lichess [terms of service](https://lichess.org/terms-of-service), an account
must _not_ have played any games before being converted to a bot account. The
first time you run the application, your account will automatically be upgraded
to a bot account. Note that you will not be able to use a bot account to play
normally on the site after it has been upgraded. We recommend that you create
two accounts -- one for the bot and one to play as a human player.

1. Create a Lichess account for your bot [here](https://lichess.org/signup).
2. Once logged in, follow [this
   link](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=bot:play&scopes[]=challenge:write) to
   generate an API token for your bot. Save the token in a secure location.
   Do not commit it to the repository.

### Fork and clone the repository

1. If you intend to contribute code or documentation to the project,
   [fork](doc/img/fork.png "fork") this repository.
2. [Clone](doc/img/clone.png "clone") (your fork of) this repository.

### Maven

Install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) either through your
operating system package manager or by downloading the latest release
[here](https://maven.apache.org/users/index.html)

#### Download the Ciera runtime library

This project contains Java classes required to run the application when code is
generated with Ciera. It also contains shared xtUML elements which are
dependencies for the xtUML project itself.

Run the following command in the terminal.
```
mvn dependency:get -DgroupId=io.ciera -DartifactId=runtime -Dversion=2.7.2
```


## Running the Application

### With xtUML Verifier

1. Open BridgePoint on a fresh workspace.

2. Import the runtime library. Select "File" > "Import..." then "General" >
   "Existing Projects into Workspace". Tick "Select archive file" and type the
   following path in the text entry:
   `<PATH_TO_MAVEN_REPO>/io/ciera/runtime/2.7.2/runtime-2.7.2.jar`. Make sure the
   "runtime" project is selected and click "Finish" to import.

   _NOTE: In a normal maven installation, the maven repository is located in a
   directory called `.m2/repository` in your home directory._

3. Import all the projects from the root of the chess repository.

4. Copy `lichess_bot/src/main/resources/lichess_bot.properties.template` to
   `lichess_bot/src/main/resources/lichess_bot.properties`

5. Edit this file and replace `<YOUR_LICHESS_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your API token
   that you generated earlier.



6. Switch to the Java perspective. Build the workspace by either clicking
   "Build All" in the "Project" menu, or by enabling "Build Automatically".

   _NOTE: It is normal at this point to see some Java errors. These will be
   cleared up later after building with Ciera, however if Verifier fails to
   launch, you may need to refresh the Maven projects._

   - Select all projects marked with a little "M" glyph.
   - Right click then "Maven" > "Update Project..."
   - Untick "Update project configuration from pom.xml"
   - Click OK
   - If it worked, you will see a "Maven Dependencies" item listed as a child
     of each Maven project

7. Select "Run" > "Debug Configurations..." and click on "LichessBot" under the
   "xtUML eXecute Application" heading.

8. Click "Debug" to launch the application.

9. Log in to your human account on lichess.org.

10. Use the [search bar](doc/img/search_opponent.png "search opponent") to navigate
   to the user page for your bot.

11. Challenge your bot to a match (by clicking on the [crossed swords](doc/img/challenge.png "challenge")).

### With Ciera

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the repository.

2. Assure the `BPHOME` environment variable is set to point to your BridgePoint
   installation folder. This should refer to the same folder containing the
   `bridgepoint.ini` file.
3. Run the command `mvn install`

4. Return to BridgePoint and open the Java perspective.

5. Select "Run" > "Run Configurations..." and click on "LichessBotJava" under the
   "Java Application" heading.

6. Click "Run" to launch the application.

### With MC-3020 C

1. Clone this git repository:  [ChessLib Implemented in ANSI C - thearst3rd](https://github.com/thearst3rd/chesslib),
   which is a C implementation of 'ChessLib' used to supply legal moves.
   It is important that you clone this repo as a peer to your chess repo
   (having the same parent directory in the filesystem).  The makefile
   will assume that `chesslib` is "right next to" `chess`.

2. Follow the instructions to build the `chesslib` library (basically running `make`).

3. In BridgePoint, in the 'xtUML Modeling' perspective, select the 'lichess_bot'
   project and 'Build Project'.  This will generate C code from your bot model.

4. From a command line, navigate to `chess/lichess_bot/src`.

5. Run `make` to compile your generated C code and link in the chesslib library.

6. From a command line, navigate to `chess/lichess_api`.

7. Create folders `incoming` and `outgoing`.  This is for file-based communication
   between the Lichess API Standalone application and the running C program.

8. Copy the "lichess_bot.properties" file from
   `chess/lichess_bot/src/main/resources/` to the `chess/lichess_api/`
   directory.

9. In the same folder (`lichess_api`), run the C program by executing
   `../lichess_bot/bin/cbot3020`.

10. From BridgePoint, from the Java perspective, in the Package Explorer,
    navigate to `src/main/java/lichess`.

11. Right-click on LichessAPIStandalone.java and run as Java Application.

12. You can now challenge your bot as with Verifier and Ciera.


### Bot versus Bot

The chess model normally awaits a challenge.  But the chess model is happy
to challenge a human or another bot.  Following are steps to cause your
running chess model to challenge another lichess person/bot.

1. If running with Ciera, add an invocation to 'send_challenge' at the end
   of the 'chess::connected' port message handler.
2. Replace the username in 'send_challenge' with the user you want to
   challenge. At the moment, it is 'maia1', but it can be a human user or
   another bot.  Keep in mind that not all bots accept all challenges
   depending on the properties of the challenge (time control, rated/unrated,
   bot/human, etc).
3. Build (if running in ciera) and launch the application.
4. If running in Verifier, navigate in the session explorer to the
   'send_challenge' function and execute it.
5. If you watch the console output, you will see a message that gives a
   URL to watch.  You can paste that into a browser, and it will take you to
   the in-progress game.  This is automatic when running in Verifier.
6. Another way to watch is to go to

   ```
   https://lichess.org/@/<your-bot-username>/tv
   ```

   If you have an in-progress
   game, it will show up there, or if you navigate to this URL beforehand, it
   will automatically show the game when your bot starts playing.

For development, it is convenient to have two bot accounts in addition to
your human account, so that you can run your bot (in one account) against
the teacher (random move) bot (in another account).  Or, you can run your
bot model against other bot models.


## Adding bot intelligence

The template project provides the minimum amount of intelligence to play a
game. On its turn, the bot will select a random move from the list of legal
moves and play that move. It is the task of the modeler to improve this
behavior to create a winning strategy.

### Interfaces

The `chess` interface provides a modeled hook into the lichess.org public API.
For more information on this API, visit the Lichess documentation page
[here](https://lichess.org/api). Messages and types were modeled to closely
follow this reference.

### Utilities

The `ChessLib` utility has been provided with the `legalMoves` bridge. This
bridge takes as input an array of moves that have occurred in the game since
the start position. It returns an array of legal moves.

_This section is a work in progress_

### Move representation

Each move is represented by a 4 character string in [Long Algebraic
Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)#Long_algebraic_notation)
-- a four character string in which the first two characters represent the file
(column) and rank (row) on which the moved piece started and the last two
characters represent the file and rank on which the moved piece completed its
move. In standard chess vocabulary, a _move_ represents a move by white and a
corresponding response by black. In the model, however, each move by black _or_
white is represented as its own element in the array of moves representing the
state of the game. A natural consequence of this fact is that if the length of
the move array is divisible by 2, it is white's turn to play. If the array is
not divisible by 2, it is black's turn to play.

### Extending the application

The application consists of two components -- `Engine` and `Lichess`. The
`Lichess` component is a realized component and should not be edited by the
modeler.

The modeler has freedom to extend the application as desired. A natural
starting place is the "our turn" state within the `Game` instance state machine
in the `Engine` component. Here the bot must select the next move and then
generate the "play move" event.

### Chess rules and strategy

lichess.org requires bots to play according to standard chess rules. The moves
returned by the `ChessLib` EE will also observe the rules and only return legal
moves. Any move selected by a bot to play next should be one of these legal
moves.

An excellent resource for learning the rules and some basic bot strategies is
the Chess Programming Wiki found
[here](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page). The official rules of chess
can be found [here](https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/LawsOfChess.pdf).
